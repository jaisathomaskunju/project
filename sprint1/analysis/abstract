Introduction 
The Radiologist have to spend more time diagnosing the chest X-ray image to find any potential lung diseases.Beacause X-ray image contains large amount of complex data.
Diagnosing X-Ray require careful observation and knowledge of anatomical principles, physiology and pathology.
Developing automated system for such could make a huge impact to the patients, who donâ€™t have access to expert radiologist.
Our goal is to develop a scheme capable of both classifying the thoracic disease and localizing the diseased part in the X-ray image. 
Perform experimental analysis on chest X-ray dataset published by National Institute of Health(NIH).
It comprised of 1,12,120 X-Ray images with diseases labels from 30,805 unique patients.
Each image labelled with up to 14 diseases.
X-Ray images are grey scale images with 1024*1024  in resolution.
In this work, we applied traditional machine learning techniques for automated detection of thoracic diseases.
We aim to use chest X-ray images as input with labels
Output is disease present or not.
