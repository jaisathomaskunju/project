Feasibility study

Feasibility study is the assessment of the practicality of the proposed system.
Feasibility study aims to objectively uncover the strength and weakness of the proposed system.
Once it has been determined, that the project is feasible and the analyst can go ahead and prepare the project specification.

Technical Feasibility

Hardware Specification
	Processor : Intel I5
	RAM        : 8 GB
	Keyboard : entry texel quite keyboard
Software specification
	Backend    : TenserFlow
	Frontend    : Keras

Economic Feasibility

Economic feasibility is used for evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed system.
This determines the benefits and savings that are expected from the system and compared with cost and time.
It is cost effective. Because there is only a one time implementation cost.

Social Feasibility
Social feasibility is a determination of whether a proposed project will be acceptable to the people or not.
Correctly interpreting the information is always a major challenge for doctor.
Our network can produce accurate disease classification and localization, which can potentially support clinical decisions.
Easley detect the diseases with a very short range of time.
For e.g., even for the experienced doctors it is sometimes not easy to distinguish diseases when contrast of surrounding tissue is very low.
Easy to use medical diagnostic technique
Improving the accuracy of disease detection
